#                                            Scale Project

Author: Matthew Ciraula

    The goal of this project is to create an interactive application for displaying scale patterns
on a guitar fretboard. At the moment I have only created data structures and a simple test program.
As I continue to work on this project in my spare time my goals are to first make an interactive
command line interface, and later, a full GUI application.
